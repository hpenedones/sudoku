Sudoku solver
======

This sudoku solver finds the most constrained cell, choses a feasible number, and proceeds recursively.
At some point in the future it might have to backtrack and try another path. 
My goal was to use the solver to identify the hardest puzzles. The measure of difficulty for a puzzle was how many times my algorithm had to backtrack on it. 

At the bottom of this page I show the hardest sudoku puzzles I found. Here is how you can reproduce the experiments by yourself:

Requirements
------

To run the solver you just need a C compiler, such as gcc. 
To do the full analysis you will also need gnuplot and ImageMagick convert tool, and some sort of Unix/Linux shell.

Compilation
------

> gcc solver.c -o solver
 
Usage
------


The input is assumed to come from the standard input, and the program will print to the standard output.
There is one command line argument, which defines the format of the input: 

 1. Grid:

``` 
 53__7____
 6__195___
 _98____6_
 8___6___3
 4__8_3__1
 7___2___6
 _6____28_
 ___419__5
 ____8__79
```

 2. Linear:

``` 
 530070000600195000098000060800060003400803001700020006060000280000419005000080079
```

Example:

> ./solver 2 < puzzle.txt


Finding hard Sudoku puzzles
======

Instead of outputting the puzzle solution, we can instead output the number of backtrackings that the algorithm had to perform to achieve that solution. This gives an estimate on how hard the puzzle is.
I didn't put a command line option for this, but you can just (un)comment the appropriate lines in the main routine:

```C
print(&s, 1);    // prints the solution
// printf("%d\n", s.nbacktracks);  // prints how many times it had to backtrack
```

I downloaded a file with about 50000 puzzles (with 17 given numbers, out of the 81):

> wget http://school.maths.uwa.edu.au/~gordon/sudoku17 -O puzzles.txt

Then I computed the number of backtracks per puzzle for all of them (which takes a few hours!):

> ./solve 1 < puzzles.txt > nbacktracks.txt

And generated an histogram with gnuplot. I have a script called make_histograms.sh containing this:

> cat nbacktracks.txt | sort -n | awk -F" " '{print exp(int(log($1))) }' | uniq -c > histogram.txt

> echo "set xlabel '#backtracks to solve (log-scale)';"               > plot.gnu

> echo "set ylabel 'Frequency';"                             >> plot.gnu

> echo "set output 'histogram.png'"                     >> plot.gnu

> echo "set term png"                                        >> plot.gnu

> echo "set logscale x;"                        >> plot.gnu

> echo "plot 'histogram.txt' u 2:1 w boxes t 'Sudoku 17-puzzles' ;"  >> plot.gnu


You can then run: 
 
> ./make_histograms.sh

> gnuplot plot.gnu

It's curious that with a logscale x-axis the distribution looks like a Gaussian. I don't have an explanation for this, however. And it's quite impressive to see that some puzzles need about 1 million backtrackings!
I decided to locate the hardest and share them here. Let me know if you also found them hard to solve!


> paste nbacktracks.txt puzzles.txt | sort -nr | head -n 10

Ok, so now we need to render this sudoku puzzles in a human-friendly fashion. So we proceed as follows:

We store the top 10 sudoku in a file (drop the backtrack counts):

> paste nbacktracks.txt puzzles.txt | sort -nr | head -n 10 | cut -f 2 > top10.txt

Download an empty sudoku board image from somewhere in the web (searched google images with "sudoku empty"):

> wget http://www.scouk.net/entertainment/sudoku/blank_grid.gif

And now we are ready for some awesomeness! 

Rendering Sudoku puzzles
------

We use ImageMagick convert tool to do the full rendering in one line:

> i=1; cat top10.txt | while read line;  do echo $line | fold -w 9 | tr 0 " " | head -c 89 | convert  -pointsize 100 -font Courier -size 531x721 label:@- puzzle.png ; convert puzzle.png -border 10x10 -splice 0x10 -resize 328x328\! puzzle.png; convert blank_grid.gif puzzle.png -average hardest_sudoku_$i.png; i=`expr $i + 1`; done

Done!

We can now display the top 10 hardest sudoku puzzles (according to my solver):
